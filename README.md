# Mycotoxin Level Prediction in Corn Samples using Hyperspectral Imaging

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for predicting mycotoxin levels (e.g., DON concentration) in corn samples using hyperspectral imaging data. The project involves data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction using PCA, and training a **CNN-GRU hybrid model** for regression. The model's performance is evaluated using regression metrics such as **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **RÂ² Score**.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
To run the project, you need Python 3.6 or higher. The following libraries are required:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mycotoxin-prediction.git
   cd mycotoxin-prediction
